## Bio
I am a PhD student in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.
I am interested in a wide variety of problems in high energy astrophysics theory.
I am currently working on
(1) tidal disruptions of stars by black holes,
(2) common envelope evolution in the context of gravitational wave sources,
(3) accretion onto neutron stars in a dense medium, and
(4) the structure of AGN disks with embedded stars.
I have also worked on vacuum decay and de Sitter space in string theory.

I did my undergraduate at Harvard in Physics and Astrophysics.
There I did work in experimental particle physics on the Higgs to WW decay channel for ATLAS,
and in cosmology on custering-mass/color relationships in SDSS galaxies and on resolving excess large-scale power and North/South differences in the SDSS.

## Advocacy
Put your money to good use (if you have more than you need). Effective altruism / charity resources:
the <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/">Open Philanthropy Project</a>,
<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>,
<a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org">The Life You Can Save</a>,
<a href="https://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>,
<a href="https://80000hours.org">80,000 hours</a>.
Or give directly to
the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com">Against Malaria Foundation</a>
and/or the <a href="https://www.evidenceaction.org/">Deworm the World Initiative</a>,
two of the most effective charities. 

Climate change is real and is one of the major threats to humanity's long-term survival; it is also responsible for
the recent water scarcity crises in several countries.

Within academia and particularly in physics and astronomy, there are far fewer people from underrepresented groups in undergraduate majors,  phd positions, postdoctoral positions, and professorships than are reflected in the demographic makeup of the US (and the world).
The field needs to do something about this---this includes developing equitable and inclusive hiring, admissions, and
grant and telescope proposal reviewal practices, as well as recruiting and retaining students from diverse groups in
undergraduate and graduate education.
Regarding this aim in astronomy graduate education, the AAS recently put out a report on the status of diversity and inclusion as well as their
recommendations: <a href="https://aas.org/education/aas-task-force-diversity-and-inclusion-graduate-astronomy-education">
